# Final Project In Software Engineering Practical Course
This repository contains the code for a project utilizing ROS (Robot Operating System) to control a Duckiebot robot. 
The project's purposes are lane-following, navigation, object detection, obstacle avoidance, and more to come!
## How to use it

### 1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/nikakhalatiani/ROS-Duckiebot-Project.git
cd ROS-Duckiebot-Project
```

### 2. Build the project (needs to be done on each change)

Use `dts devel build -f` command to do this.

### 3. Run code on a Bot

Use `dts devel run -R BOTNAME -L saxeli -X` command to do this
**_NOTE:_** `saxeli` is name of file so it's here to stay
